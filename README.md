A binary logistic regression model was developed to predict the smoking status of adult survey respondents based on 20 health-related predictor variables. The model's performance was evaluated and found to have an average accuracy (F1-score) of 68% with a good discriminatory ability (area under the ROC curve of 0.75). The model was able to correctly predict 319 cases of 'smoker' and 461 cases of 'nonsmoker', but also misclassified a certain number of cases. The model's performance is not perfect and further exploration of the data and other models that work better with unbalanced datasets is recommended.
