A logistic regression model was built to predict the smoking status of adult survey respondents based on 20 health-related predictor variables. The model achieved an average accuracy (F1-score) of 68%. The model had good discriminatory ability as indicated by the area under the ROC curve. The confusion matrix shows that the model correctly predicted some cases and misclassified some cases. The model's performance is not perfect and further exploration of the data and other models is recommended. To improve the model's performance, it is recommended to try other models that work better with unbalanced datasets.
